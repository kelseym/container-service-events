# Changelog

## 2.0.0

Not yet released.

### Features

* [CS-29][] Enable output handlers to have type "`Assessor`". If a command output points to an assessor XML, the output handler can now upload that XML and create the assessor object in XNAT.

### Bugfixes


[CS-29]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-29

## 1.6.0

Not yet released.

### Features

* Change name of Command Wrapper Output property `as-a-child-of-wraper-input` to `as-a-child-of`. This is to support [CS-80][] and allow uploading outputs to other outputs. (Note that the title of the database column has not changed, and is still `wrapperInputName`.)
* [CS-80][] Allow command wrapper output handlers to create new objects as children of objects created by previous output handlers. The previous behavior allowed outputs to be handled only by wrapper inputs.
* [CS-457][] Add `label` field to command wrapper. This will be used to represent the command wrapper in the "Run Container" menu going forward.
* [CS-458][] `GET /commands/available` includes command and wrapper labels
* Manually refresh resource catalog when uploading resources. (We used to rely on the Catalog Service to do this, but it doesn't anymore.)
* [CS-407][] Add docker host setting to translate mount paths. If xnat sees a path at /data/xnat/x/y/z but your docker host sees the same path at /my/path/x/y/z, you can include these path prefixes in your docker server settings. If you're using REST, set the properties "path-translation-xnat-prefix" and "path-translation-docker-prefix" respectively. If you're using the Plugin Settings UI, the fields will be there.
* [CS-494][] Add docker host setting for whether to check on server startup if all the images referenced by commands are present, and pull them if not.
* [CS-502][] When a container is launched with the project-specific launch APIs (`/xapi/projects/{project}/.../launch`), that project is now saved as a property on the container.
* [CS-503][] Add APIs to get containers by project.
* [CS-513][] Increase length of several fields:
    * Command
        * Description
        * Command-line
    * Command Input
        * Description
        * Default value
    * Command Wrapper
        * Description
    * Command Wrapper Derived Input
        * Description
        * Default value
    * Command Wrapper External Input
        * Description
        * Default value
    * Container
        * Command-line
* Include a container's database ID in the `LaunchReport` returned after launch.
* Add a new container status: "Finalizing". This is set when the container has finished and container service begins its finalization process (uploading outputs and logs). When finalization is finished, the status is set to "Complete" as before.
* [CS-535][] Add command and wrapper input property `sensitive`. This boolean property, when set to true, will cause the value to be masked out in the container history UI and REST API. (The value is still present in the database and may be printed to logs.) In addition, if *any* inputs on a command / wrapper are marked as sensitive, the `raw` type inputs—i.e. those input values that were sent by the user and saved before any processing—will not be shown in the UI or API. The reason being that 1. if sensitive information exists, it may be leaked by raw inputs; 2. we have no way for the user to tell us anything about the raw inputs, including their potential sensitivity; thus 3. we can't guarantee any of their values are not sensitive.
* Add another rest endpoint for `/commands/available` that takes project in path instead of query: `/projects/{project}/commands/available?xsiType={whatever}` instead of `/commands/available?project={project}&xsiType={whatever}`.

### Bugfixes

* [CS-488][] Allow wrappers to derive `Session` inputs from `Assessor` inputs, in the same way you can derive `Session`s from `Scan`s.
* [CS-492][] Save `override-entrypoint` property on `Container` entity. (It was being used properly to make the docker container, but not saved in database.)
* [CS-510][] Enable fetching logs from a running service.
* History UI now fetches logs by container database id, not container docker id (or service id).
* [CS-520][] Can get containers by service ID. This applies to the internal `ContainerService.get(String id)` as well as REST `/xapi/containers/{id}`.
* Prevent generating duplicate `ContainerEntityHistory` items (and audit table entries) by improving equality check.
* [CS-409] Derived input values now sent to the launch UI as ID or name or value, rather than URI. Conversely, derived input values *can* be interpreted as URIs or IDs or names, whereas before each type of derived input had its own special undocumented requirement for an input value to be interpreted.
* [CS-531][] CommandWrapperEntity derivedInputs, externalInputs, and outputHandlers and CommandEntity inputs, outputs, wrappers, and mounts sorted by primary table id.

### Other

* [CS-537][] References to the dummy TransportService removed, as it was a placeholder for functionality implemented elsewhere.
* [CS-480][] Deprecate `Container.ContainerMount.inputFiles`. Having a list of input files for a mount is nice during command resolution, but it doesn't make much sense to store that list. As of now no new containers will have anything in their mounts' `inputFiles`. Old containers will still report their values for `inputFiles` for now, but this may change in the future.
* Remove the constant log entries for event polling. We get it. You're checking for events.

## 1.5.1

[Released 2018-03-15](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.5.1).

### Bugfixes

* [CS-479][] Restores wildcard expansion for container command-line strings.
    To do this, modified behavior introduced in previous version. When `override-entrypoint` is `null` or `false`, the container is created with...
    ```
    Image.Cmd = COMMAND (split into tokens like a shell would)
    Image.Entrypoint = null (to leave the entrypoint it as is)
    ```
    But when `override-entrypoint` is `true`...
    ```
    Image.Cmd = ["/bin/sh", "-c", COMMAND]
    Image.Entrypoint = null (to leave the entrypoint it as is)
    ```
    Adding back the explicit `/bin/sh` is what restores the ability to expand wildcards.

[CS-479]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-479

## 1.5.0

[Released 2018-02-15](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.5.0).

### Features

* [CS-464][] Wrapup commands / containers
* [CS-461][] and [CS-462][] Change handling of image entrypoint. (Reverts changes introduced in 1.4.0 by [CS-433][].) For discussion of this issue, see this [xnat_discussion board post][entrypoint-post].
    The APIs we had been using are these for containers...
    ```
    Image.Cmd = ["/bin/sh", "-c", COMMAND]
    Image.Entrypoint = [""]
    ```
    And these for swarm services...
    ```
    ContainerSpec.Command = ["/bin/sh", "-c", COMMAND]
    ContainerSpec.Args = null
    ```
    This caused the image entrypoint to be overriden in all cases, with no recourse for the command author. With this pair of changes, we change the way we use the APIs to launch containers in all cases, but also provide an optional property on the Command (`"override-entrypoint"`) for whether to override the entrypoint or not (defaulting to `false`, i.e. do not override). So now, whether overriding the entrypoint or not, we pass the resolved command-line string to this API for containers...
    ```
    Image.Cmd = COMMAND (split into tokens like a shell would)
    ```
    Depending on whether the entrypoint is overridden or not, we set this value for containers...
    ```
    Image.Entrypoint = [""] (to override the entrypoint, or)
    Image.Entrypoint = null (to leave the entrypoint it as is)
    ```
    For swarm services, we have to use different APIs depending on whether we override the entrypoint or not. When not overriding, we use...
    ```
    ContainerSpec.Command = null
    ContainerSpec.Args = COMMAND (split into tokens like a shell would)
    ```
    When overriding, we use
    ```
    ContainerSpec.Command = ["/bin/sh", "-c", COMMAND] (command not split into tokens, because the /bin/sh will do that)
    ContainerSpec.Args = null
    ```
* [nrgxnat/container-service#6][] Add option to reserve memory and/or limit memory and CPU usage of containers via command entries "reserve-memory", "limit-memory", "limit-cpu". Update command documentation accordingly.

### Bugfixes

* [CS-475][] Ensure references to setup and wrapup containers can be resolved unambiguously by including the name of the source object on the parent container for which we created this particular setup or wrapup container.
* Run tests in swarm mode as well as non-swarm. Fix bugs and broken tests.

## 1.4.0

[Released 2018-01-05](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.4.0).

### Features

* [CS-421][] Add Setup Commands. These are special commands that can be used to pre-process files from XNAT before they are mounted into a container launched from a "main" command.
* [CS-355][] When deleting a docker image through CS API, also delete all commands and wrappers associated with the image.
* Docs: Add new script that bulk uploads all changed source docs

* [CS-340][] Check in generated swagger.json from REST API dump, and scripts to upload it to wiki
* Add lots of new documentation
    * [CS-434][] Command resolution
    * [CS-434][] Container launching (internals)
    * Container launching (as a user)
    * Enabling commands on a project
    * Troubleshooting

### Bugfixes

* Docs: Fix mishandling of anchor tags/links on wiki pages. Confluence uses a macro for these, not raw HTML anchors.
* [CS-420][] Fix handling of non-standard default values for boolean inputs in bulk launches
* [CS-432][] Do not update container/workflow status if new events come in from docker and container is already in a "terminal" state (Completed, Failed, Killed, or related states)
* [CS-433][] Remove image entrypoints when launching containers.
* [CS-435][] Command wrappers with no descriptions were not displaying properly in the UI
* [CS-442][], [CS-443][], [CS-449][] Multiple failures when running XNAT in a non-root context: pulling images, project settings, bulk launching
* [CS-448][] Fix height of 'Edit Command' dialog so full code editor is displayed
* [CS-450][] Restrict usage of command automation to commands that match the context of selected events
* [CS-454][] Container working directory was not being saved at launch

## 1.3.2

[Released 2017-11-08](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.3.2).

### Features

* [CS-282][] Deprecated the "Project Opt-in" setting that wanted to set a default behavior for projects when a new command was added to a site. The UI existed and appeared to do things but was not tied to a functional API.

### Bugfixes

* [CS-335][] Fix permissions errors with command project configuration
* [CS-348][] Ensure that project defaults would be used for container launches where present, instead of defaulting to site-wide defaults
* [CS-389][] Set ":latest" as the default tag value when importing an image
* [CS-392][] Improve behavior of dialog when removing project-specific defaults for a command
* [CS-399][] Refresh image list when deleting a command config
* [CS-410][] Fix command update so all fields in all child objects can update too
* [CS-402][] Commands launched automatically on session archive now create workflows
* [CS-402][] Remove en-dash from scan label. This allows automated launches to succeed.
* [CS-414][] Fix bug that caused command automation button to disappear when panel refreshed
* [CS-415][] Do not read old container events after updating docker server settings
* [CS-416][] Fix a lot of extraneous error messages when launching containers on scans of the form "Cannot construct a (whatever) URI. Parent URI is null."
* [CS-418][] Fix a bug with the handling of boolean checkboxes in the command launch UI"

## 1.3.1

[Released 2017-10-11](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.3.1).

### Features

* [CS-376][] Enable bulk launching of containers from data tables on the project report page. Any filters that the user sets on these tables will be reflected in the list of items that get prepared for launch. The user can then confirm, select or deselect any of those items before launching containers. This feature also works for any project-specific stored search.

[CS-376]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-376

### Bugfixes

* [CS-395][] Catch a rare error that causes the search ID for a project data table to expire within an active session. This interrupts the user's ability to launch a batch of containers from this table.
* [CS-396][] Update text of buttons and dialogs related to bulk launches.

[CS-395]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-395
[CS-396]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-396

## 1.3.0

[Released 2017-09-29](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.3.0).

### Features

* [CS-1][] Docker swarm integration. You can configure the container service to launch services on your docker swarm by pointing it to your swarm master and setting Swarm Mode to true. This is a global setting; when swarm mode is turned on all jobs will be run as services sent to the swarm master, when it is off all jobs will be run as containers on the docker server. In addition, the docker server `ping` function in swarm mode will check not only if the specified server is reachable, but also that it is configured as a swarm master (i.e. it has to respond correctly to `docker node ls`).
* [CS-377][] Allow editing of command definitions through the Admin UI. In order to make this work, a few fields have to be edited out of the command definition to prevent an ID conflict.
* [CS-368][] Add date filtering and sorting to container history table.
* [CS-381][] Improve layout of images panel in Admin UI
* [CS-383][] Allow command wrappers to use the context `"site"` to run at a site-wide context. Unlike wrappers with other datatype-specific contexts, these will not receive any object as an external input at runtime.

## 1.2.1

[Released 2017-09-06](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.2.1).

### Features

* [CS-343][] Whenever a container is launched, create a workflow. Keep the status updated as the container's status changes. This allows us to piggyback on the existing workflow UI (history table, alert banner, etc.) to display container status.
* [CS-359][] Docker server is now stored in a hibernate table rather than as a prefs bean. This should ease a possible future transition to multiple docker servers.
* [CS-346][] Project owners that have set new default run-time settings for command configurations can reset those settings to the site-wide defaults.
* [CS-374][] Add lots of properties to the xnat model objects, which are now available to use in commands:
    * Assessor
        * `project-id`
        * `session-id`
    * Session
        * `subject-id`
    * Scan
        * `project-id`
        * `session-id`
        * `frames`
        * `note`
        * `modality`
        * `quality`
        * `scanner`
        * `scanner-manufacturer`
        * `scanner-model`
        * `scanner-software-version`
        * `series-description`
        * `start-time`
        * `uid`

[CS-359]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-359
[CS-374]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-374

### Bugfixes

* [CS-349][] Assessor model objects have URLs that start with their parent session's `/experiments/{sessionId}` URL. This allows containers to be run on assessors, as long as the assessor has a defined resource directory that can be mounted.
* [CS-352][] `GET /docker/hubs` and `GET /docker/hubs/{id}` return correct `ping`.
* [CS-373][] Docker events will only be recorded in container history once.
* [CS-295][], [CS-353][] Only enable the command automation panel if commands are available to use in the container service, and only allow automations to use enabled commands.
* [CS-367][] Fix the display issues that caused long command labels to get cut off in the Actions Box "Run Containers" menu.
* [CS-351][] Don't automatically treat new image hosts as the default image host in the Admin control panel.

## 1.2

[Released 2017-08-18](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.2).

### Features

* [CS-356][] This version, and forseeable future versions, will continue to support XNAT 1.7.3.
* Ping server on `GET /docker/server` and create
* [CS-111][], [CS-285][] Ping hub on /xapi/hubs operations and reflect that ping status in Admin UI
* [CS-62][] Special-case an error when someone wants to POST to /images/save but instead GETs /images/save.
* [CS-215][] POST /xapi/docker/pull will now return a 404 rather than a 500 when it cannot find the image you are attempting to pull
* [CS-318][] Containers returned from `GET /xapi/containers` and `GET /xapi/containers/{id}` now include top-level `status` property. This is mostly equal to the status in the most recent history item on the container, except for mapping the docker event statuses to more user-friendly statuses.
    * `created` -> `Created`
    * `started` -> `Running`
    * `die` -> `Done`
    * `kill` -> `Killed`
    * `oom` -> `Killed (Out of memory)`
* [CS-227][] Container inputs are no longer recorded with type `wrapper`. Now all wrapper inputs will be recorded as either `wrapper-external` or `wrapper-derived`. Containers launched and recorded before this version will still have inputs of type `wrapper`; we can't migrate them because information has been lost.
* [CS-145][], [CS-146][] Add convenience functions to the UI to enable / disable all commands in a site or in a project
* [CS-256][], [CS-307][] Force users to confirm delete request on an image that has had containers run in that XNAT
* [CS-205][], [CS-281][] Allow admins to view container logs directly in the container history table

### Bugfixes

* [CS-263][] When finalizing a container, check if user can edit parent before creating new resource. (Sorry, I thought I had already done this.)
* [CS-347][] Prevent project settings from overwritingn site-wide preferences for command configurations
* [XXX-60][], [XXX-61][] Prevent users from launching containers with input values containing strings that could be used for arbitrary code execution:

        ;
        `
        &&
        ||
        (
* [CS-349][] Better handle `/experiment/{assessor id}` URIs as inputs for assessor external inputs. (They will not be able to mount files, though. See [CS-354])
* [CS-350][] More reliably find assessor directories to mount

* [CS-337][] Fail more gracefully when user tries to use a docker host url with no scheme. An error message is logged that is not super helpful right now, but will become a little bit more helpful in a future version once [spotify/docker-client#870][] is merged and released.
* [CS-351][] Fix a bug with the "Default Image Host" toggle
* [CS-279][] Explicitly restrict access to container launch UI to project users with edit permissions (i.e. owners and members)
* [CS-297][] Fix the ability to delete a command configuration. Improve appearance of "Delete" buttons throughout the admin UI
* [CS-293][] Remove non-functional "Delete" buttons from instances in the UI where it was not supported
* [CS-341][] `GET /{some identifiers}/launch` returns `user-settable` boolean property on inputs
* [CS-339][], [CS-340][] Fix faulty display and handling of non-user-settable inputs in container launch UI
* [CS-274][] Improve functioning of Project opt-in settings.
* [CS-212][] Improve display and readability of error messages throughout
* [CS-317][], [CS-273][] Taxonomy cleanup in UI for consistency

## 1.1

[Released 2017-08-04](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/1.1).

### Features

* Integrated UI container launcher controls with the [Selectable Table plugin](https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/selectable-table-plugin) to allow users to run containers on individual scans or multiple selected scans in bulk.
* Added master controls in the Admin UI and Project Settings UI to enable and disable all available commands for individual projects and at the site-wide level.
* [CS-286][] Remove unused enable-all/disable-all APIs
* [CS-288][] Project enabled API now returns an object with project enabled boolean, project name, and command enabled boolean.
* Change launch report format. Now instead of showing either wrapper ID or command ID + wrapper name (depending on which API you used to launch the container), the launch report always shows wrapper ID and command ID. The IDs are now formatted as integers, not strings.

[CS-286]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-286
[CS-288]: https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-288

### Bugfixes

* [CS-282][] (Not actually fixed yet.) The existing (unused) `/container-service/settings` API has been removed. This clears the way for the API to be refactored in the next version.
* [CS-289][] Mounting a session no longer mounts the project
* Mark command and wrapper descriptions in LaunchUi as Nullable. This prevents a potential bug that I haven't yet seen.

[Released 2017-07-28](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases/tag/v1.0).

### Features

* Added Changelog
* Check if command exists before saving, rather than catching exception when it fails to save.
* [CS-205][] Add `/containers/{id}/logs` and `/containers/{id}/logs/{stdout|stderr}` APIs to fetch container logs.

    * `derived-from-xnat-input` -> `derived-from-wrapper-input`
    * `as-a-child-of-xnat-input` -> `as-a-child-of-wrapper-input`
* "Create docker server" API returns 201 on success, not 202.
